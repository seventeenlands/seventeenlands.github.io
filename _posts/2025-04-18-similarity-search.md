We’re excited to announce some new features: **deck similarity search** and **similar deck statistics**!

Starting today, patrons will have access to a powerful [similarity search tool](https://www.17lands.com/deck/a108afe05f2e4cb9a84c23bec977d548/0?view=similar) that allows them to see decks that are most like theirs. *Non-patrons: don’t fret; there are some goodies for you at the end too!* We have some idea of how we’ll use this in our own playing - checking what cards other users choose to include or exclude from their decks in similar situations, for example - but we’re sure people will find many other uses for it too!

Once we built out the base infrastructure for finding similar decks, we were immediately drawn to a powerful capability that it would also unlock: [card statistics from similar decks](https://www.17lands.com/deck/a108afe05f2e4cb9a84c23bec977d548/0?view=stats). In many cases, there are multiple ways to draft and build decks of a given color in each set. You might have some UW tempo decks that exist alongside more controlling UW builds. Your Temur decks could be stompy, splashy, or somewhere in between. Seeing card statistics from decks that are most similar to yours can help you in the research phase to learn what makes those archetypes tick, and it can aid you more tactically in making decisions on your last few cuts.

Of course, we also have some good news for non patrons as well: the [individual card details page](https://www.17lands.com/card_data/details?card_id=95574&expansion=TDM&format=PremierDraft&start=2025-04-08) and [user personal performance graphs](https://www.17lands.com/history/events?view=performance) are now available for free to all users. We’ve always wanted to open these features to the public, and today we’re able to flip that switch! In addition, for each of your draft decks, we’ve created a Card Statistics view that makes it easy to display different slices of data for the cards in your deck. While the similarity search is restricted to patrons (given the additional infrastructure costs), we’ve enabled everyone to see statistics from all decks and/or decks of matching colors. These are filtered down only for the cards in your deck, right next to your deck list, to help you make your final deckbuilding decisions.

As always, happy drafting!

*Note that similarity search data has only been backfilled through DFT. You can find all this on your existing decks pages starting today.*
