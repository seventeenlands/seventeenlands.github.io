As 17Lands continues to grow more and more popular (tens of thousands of you access it every day!), our costs rise. We're blessed to have a great core of volunteers who develop and maintain the site, and equally blessed and thankful that our patrons are able to meet the processing, storage, and hosting costs. We want to make sure 17Lands is around for a long time, and we want to continue adding more features, tools, and insightful content for years to come. While we know our patrons contribute for the same reason we built the site in the first place - to help the Limited community learn and improve - we’ve wanted to better thank them for their support for a long time. In order to do that, we're investing in keeping them happy and giving perks for showing their support. Today, we’re incredibly excited to announce a new slate of features for our patrons!

Our mission has always been to help the entire Magic community improve through open aggregation of data, and now that 17Lands has become a cornerstone of Limited players, we take that commitment even more seriously. Non-patrons should continue to have access to all the same features on the website that have been available historically, and we plan to continue adding many more public features and improvements. As we develop new features, we'll consider their costs and the overall site costs against our Patreon revenue to properly evaluate what access restrictions we may need to place on them. If things go well, we also hope to be able to expand access to some of these features as funding grows and as we find ways to reduce their costs. We’ve been working hard to implement this new set of features, and we hope you love them! You can find details about each of the new features below.

### Win Rate History

This new chart available on your event history page shows how your win rate trends over time. We currently show running averages for your last 10, last 50, and all-time event win rates. Use the existing filters on your event history page to restrict it by set, event type, or date range.

_Availability: Common patrons and above_

### Card Breakdown Page

Want to do a deep dive on individual cards? This new card-focused view provides a summary of how the card does across different deck colors, how it ranks among other cards, how its performance has changed over time, and more!

_Availability: Common patrons and above_

### Personal Color Performance

We’ve added a new “me” option in the user group drop-down on a few pages. Here, it will let you see how much you’re playing each deck color as well as what sort of success you’re having with them.

_Availability: Uncommon patrons and above. Data is available for any day in which you are (or were) an uncommon or higher patron, starting 2023-09-03. Data updates daily._

### Personal Card Performance

Have you ever wondered what the GIH WR for a card is in only your decks? Do you want to know how often you include a certain card in your maindeck? We’ve added the “me” filter to the card data and card data performance pages as well so you can check out these and any of our other card-based statistics. Sample sizes will be small, but it can still be fun to look at!

_Availability: Uncommon patrons and above. Data is available for any day in which you are (or were) an uncommon or higher patron, starting 2023-09-03. Data updates daily._

### Manabase Evaluator

For those interested in an objective opinion on how responsible your manabase is, we’ve implemented a new Manabase Evaluator that runs thousands of simulations with your deck to estimate how castable your cards are. This isn’t a simple hypergeometric calculator. We simulate the effects of cards that fetch lands from your deck, permanents that produce mana, mana fixers, and more - but only if you can cast them! We even incorporate effects from the best-of-one hand smoother when appropriate. This tool is pretty complicated, so we’ve split out further detail for this in a separate post, which you can find [here](/posts/manabase-evaluator/).

![](/assets/img/posts/2023-09-28-patron-exclusives/manabase_evaluator.png){: width="500px" max-width="100%" }

_Availability: Rare patrons and above. Data is available for any day in which you are (or were) an rare or higher patron, starting 2023-09-10. Mana evaluation data should generally be available within a few seconds of your deck being visible on the site._

It's thanks to your financial support that we're able to store, aggregate, and analyze terabytes of data for the benefit of the whole Limited community. These new features are our way of giving a little bit back to the core patrons who have helped support our growth.

## FAQ<

_I’m a patron, but it says I don’t have access. How do I fix that?_

Access to these features is dependent on us being able to link your 17Lands account to your Patreon account. You can confirm your current level by visiting your [17Lands account page](https://www.17lands.com/account). If your level is listed as “N/A” (or doesn’t match your current contribution), please send us a message on Patreon with your client token or the email address you used to register for 17Lands and we’ll get things updated ASAP!

_Can non-patrons still access the site?_

Of course! Non-patrons should continue to have access to all the same features on the website that have been available historically, and we plan to continue to add many more public features and improvements. Eventually, we may need to expire older data for non-patrons to keep costs in check, but we hope to delay this as long as possible and don’t have any plans to do so currently.
