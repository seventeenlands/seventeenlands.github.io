It's time for the start of a new series: Deck Superlatives! For this series, we're giving awards to some Premier Draft trophy decks that wound up on the extreme end of some metrics. This is just meant as a fun way to highlight some interesting decks that were submitted to 17Lands, and not as a way to say that these are the best or worst decks.

_For the first three awards, all submitted trophy decks are eligible, so long as they used the same deck list for all their games. For the next three awards, which utilize [our similarity search functionality](/posts/similarity-search/), only decks decks submitted by Patrons are eligible._

_MTGA account names are listed for deck owners who have "visible on public pages" selected on their [17Lands account settings page](https://www.17lands.com/account)._

# Villainous Wealth

The <auto-card>Villainous Wealth</auto-card> award goes to the trophy deck with the most rares. We give a bit of a bump for mythics and an additional small edge to bonus sheet cards. The winner is [this deck](https://www.17lands.com/deck/056333cc711749c3b43c83fd21061cf7/0), which had a whopping 5 mythic rares, 3 normal rares, and a handful of good uncommons to boot:

# Vampire Spawn

The <auto-card>Vampire Spawn</auto-card> award is for the opposite end of the spectrum: the trophy deck with the lowest overall rarity. The winner here is **mateo** with [this deck](https://www.17lands.com/deck/fd745d405d604e39bc3191b21df0c21d/0), which was the only deck to trophy with just two uncommons and the rest commons:

# Jeskai Revelation

Are these the best decks of the format? Our similarity search feature says they might be... The <auto-card>Jeskai Revelation</auto-card> award goes to the trophy deck with the highest average win rate of the decks in its neighborhood, i.e. the 20 most similar decks. In this case, we had three decks that trophied with a neighborhood win rate of 74%:
