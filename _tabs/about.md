The mission of 17Lands is to help the Magic: The Gathering community improve at limited. We aggregate and openly share data to help players understand their own performance, to generate insights that can only come from a larger communal pool of data, and to provide data-driven content.

This blog is in service of that mission. Here we aim to provide content using the aggregated data collected by the tracker.
